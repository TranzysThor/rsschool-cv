As a *young* student, I aspire to achieve *any* goals I've set, some of them being **hard**, like getting a university degree or getting a *vast* knowledge in computer science to become a professional programmer. These goals may be achieved through *hard work* **and** *continuous learning*. With that being said, I should underline my *strengths*:
* hard-working
* _passion_ for learning new things
* ability to work __under__ pressure
* sociability
* kindness and understanding.
Having a lack of job experience, these __strengths__ will help me to learn new things faster and to get experience in my sphere of professional activity.
